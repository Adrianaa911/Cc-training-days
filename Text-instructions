KEY CONCEPTS - VARIABLE SCOOP!!

-- Training Days --
As a seasoned athlete, one of your favorite activities is running marathons. You use a service called Training Days that sends you a message for the event you signed up for and the days you have left to train.
Since you also code, Training Days has asked you to help them solve a problem: The program currently uses the wrong scope for its variables. They know this can be troublesome as their service evolves. In this project you will make Training Days more maintainable and less error-prone by fixing variable scopes.

Task 1:
Let’s begin by running the trainingDays.js file. In the console we can see that the program is broken!
Ideally, the getRandEvent() function selects an event at random. The getTrainingDays() function returns the number of days to train based on the event selected. The logEvent() and logTime() functions print the athlete name, event, and number of days to the console.
But poorly scoped variables are causing errors.

Task 2:
To avoid the ReferenceError, declare 'days' within the getTrainingDays function, before the if statement.
